# TH 2nd debugging code

#Syntax errrors - You wrote your code incorrectly (incorrect "Grammar")
    #print"Hello"
#Fix by reading where the problem is and fix it

#Logic Error -  the computer gets the wrong steps
    #num = "10"
    #num_two = "3"
    #print(num+num_two)
#fix by either backtracking till you find the error or you use rubber duck debugging where you tell a living thing, or an object or literally anything, what problem you are having

#Runtime Errors - code starts runnin gbut does not finish
# import random

# while True:
    #denominator = random.randint(0,5)

    #print(10/denominator)
# fix it by just changing the code so the error cant happen or you can just use an if statement if you cant do that
